## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
├── public/
├── src/
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |

## Comments API (Frontend Contract)

The Journey Comments UI expects these backend endpoints:

- `GET /api/comments?trailId=YYYY-MM-DD&limit=50`
  - Returns an array of comments:
    - `id`, `userId`, `displayName`, `message`, `createdAt`, `lat`, `lon`, `trailId`, `snapshotUrl`
- `POST /api/comments`
  - JSON body:
    - `userId`, `displayName`, `message`, `lat`, `lon`, `trailId`
  - Returns the created comment object

Existing fallback endpoint reused by the UI:

- `GET /api/last-seen`
  - Used to resolve `lat/lon` when live GPS state is unavailable.
